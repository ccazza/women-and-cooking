        <p> Women have traditionally played a big role in all parts of food, from
            gathering to production to cooking and consumption. Having been inspired
            by the incredible female chefs, who on a daily basis run kitchens around
            the world, we decided to build this website showcasing their abilities and
            achievements. Here you will find the profile of 15 inspiring female chefs
            from around the globe and links to their own personal recipes. Besides the
            profiles, you can also find a brief history of women and cooking, and the
            main adversity which they face in the kitchen nowadays: sexism. To learn
            more, please explore the website.</p>
